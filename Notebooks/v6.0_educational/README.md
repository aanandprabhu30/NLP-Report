## üî¨ **Methodological Flaws Analysis**

### **Primary Issues**

| **Flaw** | **v6.0 Implementation** | **v7.0 Correction** | **Impact** |
|----------|-------------------------|---------------------|------------|
| **Data Splitting** | Augment first, then split | Split first, then augment | +2-7% inflation |
| **TF-IDF Fitting** | Fit on entire dataset | Training data only | +1-3% inflation |
| **Feature Count** | 11,500+ features | 3,000 features | Overfitting risk |
| **Validation** | No systematic CV | 5-fold cross-validation | Unreliable estimates |

### **Data Leakage Mechanisms**

```python
# v6.0 Problematic Approach (DON'T DO THIS)
df_augmented = augment_data(df)  # Augment first
X_train, X_test = train_test_split(df_augmented)  # Then split
vectorizer.fit(df_augmented['text'])  # Fit on all data

# v7.0 Correct Approach
X_train, X_test = train_test_split(df)  # Split first
X_train_aug = augment_data(X_train)  # Augment training only
vectorizer.fit(X_train_aug['text'])  # Fit on training only
```

### **Feature Engineering Problems**

```python
# v6.0: Excessive Features (Overfitting)
tfidf = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=11500)  # Too many features
domain_features = extract_features()  # 27-55 additional features
total_features = 11527  # Prone to overfitting

# v7.0: Optimal Features (Generalization)
tfidf = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=3000)  # Optimal count
domain_features = extract_features()  # Focused features
total_features = 3000  # Balanced expressiveness/generalization
```
